dlfcn-win32 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/celmbkqj0k41fk04/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dlfcn-win32/dlfcn-win32/branch/master)
===========

dlfcn-win32 is an implementation of dlfcn for Windows.

dlfcn is a set of functions that allows runtime dynamic library loading. It is
standardized in the POSIX. Windows also provide similar routines, but not in a
POSIX-compatible way. This library attempts to implement a wrapper around the
Windows functions to make programs written for POSIX that use dlfcn work in
Windows without any modifications.

It follows the standard as described here:

Using This Library
------------------

### Using CMake

#### Use installed library

Once the library has been installed (for example by compiling from source or installing it via a package manager), add to your project `CMakeLists.txt` : 
~~~cmake
...
find_package(dlfcn-win32 REQUIRED)
...
target_link_libraries(<target> dlfcn-win32::dl)
...
~~~
If you want to use this library in a cross-platform project, a convenient way 
to proceed is to define the CMake variable [`CMAKE_DL_LIBS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_DL_LIBS.html)
(that is normally empty on Windows) and then use it for linking: 
~~~cmake
...
if (WIN32)
  find_package(dlfcn-win32 REQUIRED)
  set(CMAKE_DL_LIBS dlfcn-win32::dl)
endif ()  
...
target_link_libraries(<target> ${CMAKE_DL_LIBS})
...
~~~

When cross-compiling you might want to set [`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR.html) to the path of wine to run tests.

#### Download and build library as part of CMake build

If you do not have installed and you do not want to install the library, you can also download and build it using [CMake's FetchContent module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html). Just add in your CMake project:
~~~cmake
...
if (WIN32)
  include(FetchContent)
  FetchContent_Declare(
    dlfcn-win32
    GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/dlfcn-win32/dlfcn-win32.git"
    GIT_TAG "v1.5.0"
    SYSTEM
  )
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(dlfcn-win32)
  set(CMAKE_DL_LIBS dlfcn-win32::dl)
endif ()
...
target_link_libraries(<target> ${CMAKE_DL_LIBS})
...
~~~
